## Future

- Support real dependencies declaration, for the moment we create packages that combine the libraries
- Unit tests
- Performance tests
- Client side JS loaded, might be in the `script` package in the end
- Provide more options to declare "already loaded" parts (say gimme bootstrap.tooltip, but not jQuery)
- Test CSS imports

## Version 1.0.0 - ?
