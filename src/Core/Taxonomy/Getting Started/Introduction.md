## About
With this module you can tag any content type with any number of tags.


## How it works

First, you create a __Vocabulary__ then you create __Terms__ which can be bound to a content

A Vocabulary can contain a flat list of terms, a hierarchical list or a network

You can link terms from a vocabulary to another. As you can create a vocabulary for countries and link them to regions.
